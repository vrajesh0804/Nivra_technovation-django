# Django Advanced Portfolio Site

A practice project built with Django and modern frontend tooling to explore **advanced** view logic, template structuring, and responsive UI using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

- Custom CSS components layered on top of Bootstrap for a unique design.
- Organized static files (CSS, JS, images) and template structure for easy scaling.

## Tech Stack
